    "## Introduction to Computer Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has gained popularity in the last decade due to several reasons, such as ease of learning the programming language, versatile fields of application, a huge package ecosystem, and more importantly, because it is the de facto language for data science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital marketers have been leveraging these developments to improve their marketing campaigns and gain business insights to improve their growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss how to get ready with Python. Throughout, we will use vanilla Python from the python.org website. You will also learn \"How to set up Python on your operating system of choice?\" and \"How to setup Jupyter-Lab\". You should be able to conduct all the exercises on \"Jupyter-Lab\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Language is a way to communicate with others. Like communication between humans, we also need a way to communicate with computers and machines. However, machines only understand bits and bytes, and it is hard to program with individual bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, computer scientists have developed programming languages to communicate with and give instructions to a computer. These languages have been divided into several categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "###  Higher Level Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "A human can understand and interpret these languages without getting too deep into individual bits. Many programming languages offer features, e.g., a garbage collector, type casting, etc., without any additional effort.\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are thousands of languages invented in computing history. Most notable are Lisp and FORTRAN from early computer programming days. More languages have been developed in recent years, but they still borrow programming concepts from those old computer languages invented in the 1960s and 1970s.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no wonder that modern programming languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, and Closure are highly influenced by LiSP which was invented as a List Processing language.\n",

    "## Python as a Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language. It is very easy to learn and has human-readable syntax. Python scripts can be executed in almost all operating systems without additional configuration, e.g., Windows, Linux, Unix, Android, and even in browsers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several advantages over its rivals and competitors, e.g., MATLAB, Julia, and R-Lang. Python can be used in different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Development \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python for web development. It is possible to use Python for both dynamic and static \n",
    "\n",
    "Plone, a python-based content management system, can be used for regular content management system tasks. You can use Jinja2 as a templating engine to generate HTML pages. A plethora of open-source static site generators are written in Python, e.g., Pelican, Lektor, and MkDocs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask and FASTAPI are quite popular for API development tasks in Python. You can also deploy them as lambda functions of servers, e.g., Vercel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask, Django, Bottle, and Web2py are popular web development frameworks for Python users.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a Python alternative to Javascript to run scripts in a browser, then you will love the Brython Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### App Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to create desktop and mobile applications (for Android and Apple). Kivy is the most popular GUI framework for such tasks. You can also use QML for app development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create application programs in Python, e.g., Dropbox, Spotify, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taks Automation \n",
    "\n",
    "Most famous software also offers plugin development for extending functionalities using Python scripting, e.g., Blender for 3D or Excel with Python using the xlswings Python Package.\n",
