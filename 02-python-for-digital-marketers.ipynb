    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has gained popularity in the last decade due to several reasons, such as ease of learning the programming language, versatile fields of application, a huge package ecosystem, and more importantly, because it is the de facto language for data science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital marketers have been leveraging these developments to improve their marketing campaigns and gain business insights to improve their growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss how to get ready with Python. Throughout, we will use vanilla Python from the python.org website. You will also learn \"How to set up Python on your operating system of choice?\" and \"How to setup Jupyter-Lab\". You should be able to conduct all the exercises on \"Jupyter-Lab\"."

    "Language is a way to communicate with others. Like communication between humans, we also need a way to communicate with computers and machines. However, machines only understand bits and bytes, and it is hard to program with individual bits.\n",

    "    \n",
    "There are thousands of languages invented in computing history. Most notable are Lisp and FORTRAN from early computer programming days. More languages have been developed in recent years, but they still borrow programming concepts from those old computer languages invented in the 1960s and 1970s.\n",

    "## Python as a Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language. It is very easy to learn and has human-readable syntax. Python scripts can be executed in almost all operating systems without additional configuration, e.g., Windows, Linux, Unix, Android, and even in browsers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several advantages over its rivals and competitors, e.g., MATLAB, Julia, and R-Lang. Python can be used in different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Development \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python for web development. It is possible to use Python for both dynamic and static \n",
    "\n",
    "Plone, a python-based content management system, can be used for regular content management system tasks. You can use Jinja2 as a templating engine to generate HTML pages. A plethora of open-source static site generators are written in Python, e.g., Pelican, Lektor, and MkDocs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask and FASTAPI are quite popular for API development tasks in Python. You can also deploy them as lambda functions of servers, e.g., Vercel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask, Django, Bottle, and Web2py are popular web development frameworks for Python users.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a Python alternative to Javascript to run scripts in a browser, then you will love the Brython Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### App Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to create desktop and mobile applications (for Android and Apple). Kivy is the most popular GUI framework for such tasks. You can also use QML for app development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create application programs in Python, e.g., Dropbox, Spotify, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automation \n",
    "\n",
    "Most famous software also offers plugin development for extending functionalities using Python scripting, e.g., Blender for 3D or Excel with Python using the xlswings Python Package."

    "\n",
    "Some operating systems will include it by default, e.g., Apple OS X and Linux distributions. However, on Windows, you have to install it yourself.\n",

    "The Python interpreter was originally written in C, and CPython is the reference implementation for this purpose. There is another Python-based implementation known as PyPy. For most cases, you will only come across CPython, and the default Python distribution is more than enough for your tasks.\n",

    "### How to Download Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Python, also known as Vanilla Python, is available from the official Python website (python.org/downloads). However, being an open-source programming language, there are several other distributions (backed by commercial companies) available for download. It is important to understand the differences and choose the appropriate distribution for your use cases.\n",

    "### Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download Python from relevant Python distributions. For this course, you only need to download Python 3.10.11 from the official Python distribution website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and download it for your operating system. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "For Windows, most of you will probably need to download **Windows installer (64-bit)**. \n",
    "Click on this installer and follow the wizard. On the Installer start page, do not forget to check the checkbox for Add to System Path.\n",
    "Keep clicking \"next,\" and your Python will be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux/Unix\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will be the default language for most Linux and Unix distributions. If your Python version is outdated and you want to update it, then follow the guidelines from your respective Linux distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OSX\n",
    "\n",
    "Mac OS X will come pre-installed with the Python version. If you need to install any specific version, then please download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/. You might want to explore more options with homebrew and other managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mobile Phone\n",
    "You can also install Python on your mobile phone for learning on the go. Go to the respective app store and search for Python keywords. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Google Play\n",
    "On the Google Play store, you will find relevant apps, e.g., Pydroid. I have tested Pydroid, and it works like a charm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apple Store - IOS\n",
    "On the Apple App Store, you will find apps such as Python3IDE and Pyto. I have not tried these apps by myself, so this is not a formal recommendation."
